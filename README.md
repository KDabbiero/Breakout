# Breakout
# Overview


This game will play a simplistic version of the 80's game Breakout. At the bottom of the screen there is a paddle that moves with the arrow key. The left and down arrow key moves it to the left and the right and up arrow keys move it to the right. The ball bounces off the paddle and the bricks. Once the ball has hit the brick the brick will be deleted. 

I wanted to learn about using the arcade library to make simple games in Python.

# Useful Websites
* [Arcade API](https://arcade.academy/arcade.html?highlight=load_texture#arcade.ArcadeContext.load_texture)
* [Pymunk Download](https://pypi.org/project/pymunk/5.7.0/)
While I didn't directly use Pymunk, the latest version of Arcade that I was using didn't support the newest version of Pymunk and I had to install a previous version of Pymunk that was compatible.

# Future Work
* Add sound
* Upgrade the game to Arkanoid
* Create levels of difficulty
